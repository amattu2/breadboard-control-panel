This was a final group project for my NWIT 101 course. It includes a simple control dashboard (HTML/CSS/JS, no frameworks) which utilizes websockets to connect to a Python3 websocket server. 

# Usage
>/web

The required files for the website control panel. This directory is portable.

>/server

The required files for the websocket controller.
